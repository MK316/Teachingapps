","Okay. I'll answer question number one. First, Minsu wants to improve his score and become competent. I'll give him the tasks which satisfy Minsu's need for competence and enable him to achieve more successes in learning. Second, Suji is motivated when she has her own control in learning. For Suji, I'll give project-based activities in which she can control and all processes of the project. She can develop her automony as a result. Third,  Mina is motivated when interacting with others. I'll suggest group discusstion activity for her because it gives lots of opportunities to communicate and cooperate with group members. This is all I could answer. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
